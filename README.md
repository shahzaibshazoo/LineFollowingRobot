# LineFollowingRobot
Arduino Based Lined Following Robot Having 4 Sensors For Better Accuracy. Its a Simple Project Project with High Probabilty of Running on a black line and stop on White surface.

#!!! Before Uploading code to Arduino Makesure You Have installed AFmotor.h Library to your Arduino IDE.

## Pin Configuration.
### Connect Sensor 1 Data Pin or AO pin to Analog0 In arduino

### Connect Sensor 2 Data Pin or AO pin to Analog1 In arduino

### Connect Sensor 3 Data Pin or AO pin to Analog2 In arduino

### Connect Sensor 4 Data Pin or AO pin to Analog3 In arduino

I have Used Adafruit Motor Shield, Which can controll Upto 4 Motors but in this Case i have used 2 motors and one Bovin Wheel.
